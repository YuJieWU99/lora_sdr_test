Constructor Specific Documentation:

Return a shared_ptr to a new instance of lora_sdr::whitening.

To avoid accidental use of raw pointers, lora_sdr::whitening's constructor is in a private implementation class. lora_sdr::whitening::make is the public interface for creating new instances.

Args:
    is_hex : 
    use_length_tag : 
    separator : 
    length_tag_name : )doc";
